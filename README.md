# minesweeper
Simple minesweeper game that was coded mostly in Assembly

Only the files that were coded by myself were uploaded (>90% of displayed code is done by myself).
Therefore, the game is not complete and will not run. The code only serves as demonstration of my abilities for companies that consider employing me.
