# minesweeper
Simple minesweeper game that was coded mostly in Assembly

Only the files that were coded by myself were uploaded; (that said, parts of the code were already provided by university staff members).
Therefore, the game is not complete and will not run. The code only serves as demonstration of my abilities for companies that consider employing me.
